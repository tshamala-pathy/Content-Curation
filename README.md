# Content-Curation: Finance/Securities üìàüí∞

## Project Overview üöÄ

In light of the misinformation surrounding financial securities after the GameStop incident, this project aims to provide a reliable content curation service for both technical and non-technical users. The service offers updates on subscribed securities through an HTTP API for technical users and via email for non-technical users. Users can define the frequency of updates (daily or weekly) and create a portfolio of stocks to subscribe to. The service also provides access to market data for stocks and cryptocurrencies, as well as a popular portfolio feature.

## Features üîç

- **HTTP API for Technical Users:** Technical users can subscribe to securities and receive updates through an HTTP API. They can define the frequency of updates and access market data for stocks and cryptocurrencies.
- **Email Subscription for Non-Technical Users:** Non-technical users can subscribe to securities and receive updates via email. They can also define the frequency of updates and access market data.
- **Portfolio Management:** Users can create a portfolio of stocks to subscribe to, determining the securities for which they receive updates.
- **Digests:** Daily and weekly digests are provided, including credible news on subscribed securities. The digests may capture portions of the original articles and link directly to the source to avoid redundancy and 'stealing news'.
- **Popular Portfolio:** A popular portfolio feature captures the most popular stocks per day, available for public viewing on a website.
